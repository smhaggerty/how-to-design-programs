; Exercise 116:
; Take a look at the following sentences:
;

;
; Explain why they are syntactically legal expressions


; Exercise 117:
; Consider the following sentences:
;
;   (3 + 4)
;
;   number?
;
;   (x)
;
; Explain why they are syntactically illegal.


; Exercise 118:
;  Take a look at the following sentences:
;
;   (define (f x) x)
;
;   (define (f x) y)
;
;   (define (f x y) 3)
;
; Explain why they are syntactically legal definitions


; Exercise 119:
; Consider the following sentences:
;
;   (define (f "x") x)
;
;   (define (f x y z) (x))
;
; Explain why they are syntactically illegal.


; Exercise 120:
; Discriminate the legal from the illegal sentences:
;
;   (x)
;
;   (+ 1 (not x))
;
;   (+ 1 2 3)
;
; Explain why the sentences are legal or illegal. Determine whether the legal
; ones belong to the category expr or def.


; Exercise 121:
; Evaluate the following expressions step-by-step:
;
;   (+ (* (/ 12 8) 2/3)
;      (- 20 (sqrt 4)))
;   (cond
;     [(= 0 0) #false]
;     [(> 0 1) (string=? "a" "a")]
;     [else (= (/  1 0) 9)])
;   (cond
;     [(= 2 0) #false]
;     [(> 2 1) (string=? "a" "a")]
;     [else (= (/  1 2) 9)])
;
; Use DrRacket’s stepper to confirm your computations.


; Exercise 122:
; Suppose the program contains these definitions:
;
;   (define (f x y)
;     (+ (* 3 x) (* y y)))
;
; Show how DrRacket evaluates the following expressions, step-by-step:
;
;   (+ (f 1 2) (f 2 1))
;
;   (f 1 (* 2 3))
;
;   (f (f 1 (* 2 3)) 19)
;
; Use DrRacket’s stepper to confirm your computations.


; Exercise 123:
; The use of if may have surprised you in another way because this intermezzo
; does not mention this form elsewhere. In short, the intermezzo appears to
; explain and with a form that has no explanation either. At this point, we are
; relying on your intuitive understanding of if as a short-hand for cond. Write
; down a rule that shows how to reformulate
;
;   (if exp-test exp-then exp-else)
;
; as a cond expression.


; Exercise 124:
; Evaluate the following program, step-by-step:
;
;   (define PRICE 5)
;   (define SALES-TAX (* 0.08 PRICE))
;   (define TOTAL (+ PRICE SALES-TAX))
;
; Does the evaluation of the following program signal an error?
;
;   (define COLD-F 32)
;   (define COLD-C (fahrenheit->celsius COLD-F))
;   (define (fahrenheit->celsius f)
;   (* 5/9 (- f 32)))
;
; How about the next one?
;
;   (define LEFT -100)
;   (define RIGHT 100)
;   (define (f x) (+ (* 5 (expt x 2)) 10))
;   (define f@LEFT (f LEFT))
;   (define f@RIGHT (f RIGHT))
;
; Check your computations with DrRacket’s stepper.


; Exercise 125:
; Discriminate the legal from the illegal sentences:
;
;   (define-struct oops [])
;
;   (define-struct child [parents dob date])
;
;   (define-struct (child person) [dob date])
;
; Explain why the sentences are legal or illegal.



; Exercise 126:
; Identify the values among the following expressions, assuming the definitions
; area contains these structure type definitions:
;
;   (define-struct point [x y z])
;   (define-struct none  [])
;
;   (make-point 1 2 3)
;
;   (make-point (make-point 1 2 3) 4 5)
;
;   (make-point (+ 1 2) 3 4)
;
;   (make-none)
;
;   (make-point (point-x (make-point 1 2 3)) 4 5)
;
; Explain why the expressions are values or not.


; Exercise 127:
; Suppose the program contains
;
;   (define-struct ball [x y speed-x speed-y])
;
; Predict the results of evaluating the following expression:
;
;   (number? (make-ball 1 2 3 4))
;
;   (ball-speed-y (make-ball (+ 1 2) (+ 3 3) 2 3))
;
;   (ball-y (make-ball (+ 1 2) (+ 3 3) 2 3))
;
;   (ball-x (make-posn 1 2))
;
;   (ball-speed-y 5)
;
; Check your predictions in the interactions area and with the stepper.


; Exercise 128:
; Copy the following tests into DrRacket’s definitions area:
;
;   (check-member-of "green" "red" "yellow" "grey")
;   (check-within (make-posn #i1.0 #i1.1)
;                 (make-posn #i0.9 #i1.2)  0.01)
;   (check-range #i0.9 #i0.6 #i0.8)
;   (check-random (make-posn (random 3) (random 9))
;                 (make-posn (random 9) (random 3)))
;   (check-satisfied 4 odd?)
;
; Validate that all of them fail and explain why.
